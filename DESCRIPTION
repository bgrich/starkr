Description: This package can be used to calculate the Stark matrix for
    arbitrary state n in Rubidium-85. As part of these calculations, functions
    are included to calculate the quantum defect, radial matrix element,
    spherical harmonics, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and other necessary
    pieces for the Stark matrix element.
